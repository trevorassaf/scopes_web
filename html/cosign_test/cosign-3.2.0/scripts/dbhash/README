mkhashdirs:

mkhashdirs takes one argument, either a "1" or a "2". You should make
cosign's cookie database your working directory before you run this script.
1 will get you 64 directories, or 38 on a case-insensitive filesystem
like MacOS X. 2 will get you 4096 directories, or 1444 on a
case-insensitive filesystem.

So if I want 64 sub-directories and my cookie cache directory is
/var/cosign/daemon, I'd type the following:

example% cd /var/cosign/daemon
example% ~/src/cosign/scripts/dbhash/mkhashdirs 1

movehashdirs:

movehashdirs is your upgrade path between an un-hashed cosign cookie
database and one with 64 (38) or 4096 (1444) subdirectories. If you're
going to upgrade to a hashed database and you don't run this script, all
of you users will be instantly logged out. This script takes either "1"
or "2" and will move cookies from the top level (/var/cosign/daemon,
say) to their respective subdirectories. 

So if I want to move my sizeable cookie database into a first level
hashed cookie databsae (1), I'd type the following:

example% cd /var/cosign/daemon
example% ~/src/cosign/scripts/dbhash/movehashdirs 1
